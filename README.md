# card_index

Web project: Card file of text materials

Initial task:
- The solution must have a three-layer architecture. The data access layer, business logic, Web application should be moved into separate projects
- The interface should be a separate application using HTML, CSS, js technologies + one of the frameworks (Angular, React, etc.)
- Access to the functionality of the application services should be organized through the web API
- Implement differentiation of system users' access rights to application components (at least 2-3 roles)
- Store information about the subject area in the database, please use Entity Framework Code First for access. Use MS SQL as a DBMS
- Provide validation of user input
- Pay attention to the speed of the project, freezing of the interface when performing data loading, filtering, sorting operations are undesirable
- Code should contain XML comments (all top-level classes, non-trivial methods, and constructors)
- The code should be organized so that it can be reused and relatively easy to replace the implementation of logical parts
- Provide error handling
- Follow clean code rules - the internal organization and structure of the project code will be assessed no less carefully than the external compliance of the project with the task
- Classes and methods must have names that reflect their functionality and must be properly structured in the application (folders, namespaces)
- Code styling must comply with the C # Code Conventions (MSDN)
- Search in the card index according to various criteria.
